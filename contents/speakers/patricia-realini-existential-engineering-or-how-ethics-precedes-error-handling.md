If Javascript has taught me anything it is that when something goes wrong, only
computers can use the excuse that they are "just following orders‚Äù. Though our
code is interpreted literally by our machines, our intentions and unconscious
biases are not. By looking at the various schools of ethics available to us,
existing code of ethics for engineers, and the most pressing ethical dilemmas
plaguing our industry today, we can make the world wide web a better place for
everyone.
