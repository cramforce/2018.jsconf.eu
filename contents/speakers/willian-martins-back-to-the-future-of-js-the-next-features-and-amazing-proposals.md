Do you want to know what the next exciting JS features that you don't even know
you need? So, let me show you four proposals that may change the way you write
code as spread operator did. These features are:

- Array.prototype.flatMap
- Pipeline operator
- Partial application
- Bind operator ::

After showing the usage of these features I'd like to invite you to help TC39
push these features forward and to contribute with proposals that you'd like to
see implemented in Javascript.
