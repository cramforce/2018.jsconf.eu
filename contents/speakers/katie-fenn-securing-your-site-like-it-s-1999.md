Life in the early days of the web was hard. One day your HTML is
disintegrating, the next you are fighting someone named "*~*Ninjad00d*~*" who
has found a way to take over your forum system. Lessons in security in these
days were hard learned.

These are the true stories from the early days of the web and how forums, chat
rooms and online games were turned upside down for fun and profit. If you stick
around after laughing at the misfortune of online pioneers, there will also be
lessons about finding your way in a world that wants to exploit your every
mistake.
