Augmented reality is enabling all new experiences, interaction patterns, and
technology. As the web begins to adopt AR capabilities, this new medium is now
available to web developers.
If you know JavaScript, you can develop AR experiences that are enhancements to
an existing app, fun bite-size demos, or explore completely uncharted
territory.

We’ll explore what’s possible right now with the process of making an AR
experience on the web, including practical use-cases of “augmenting” current
web applications, as well as handling progressive enhancement of AR on
unsupported platforms. This exploration will take us to where we seem to be
heading in terms of AR as a medium on the web platform.
