Errors and debugging are the bane of a programmer’s life — and the source of
many jokes, Twitter rants, and midnight breakdowns. But how often do we

This talk will cover a short history of errors in computer science and how
errors work in Javascript itself, before looking at different approaches to
reducing errors — maybe even by embracing them.
