Photorealism has been the holy grail of computer graphics for many years. With
the introduction of WebGL and hardware accelerated APIâ€™s on the browser, Web
designers and developers were given a powerful tool to enlarge their creative
scope and communication options. In this talk Ivan will demo and explain the
concepts behind his creations, the tools he uses; from basic 3D modeling and
texturization tips, to how to assemble a complete application, wether a small
game, a product configurator, a cinematic experience, an augmented reality ad,
or a virtual reality tour, your imagination will be the limit.
