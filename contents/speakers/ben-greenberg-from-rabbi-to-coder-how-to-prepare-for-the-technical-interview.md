After ten years serving as a rabbi throughout the United States including as
the campus rabbi of Harvard University, I transitioned to being a developer.
How does a rabbi prepare for the technical interview? What are the skills
needed to succeed? This presentation is for anyone who has entered software
development from non-traditional backgrounds (i.e. music, literature,
education, sports, journalism and more). Come to be inspired and to grow in
your confidence and skillset.
