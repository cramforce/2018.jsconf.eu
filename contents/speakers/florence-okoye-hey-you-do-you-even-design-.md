How do we move beyond designing and building ever more myopic services that
barely improve on our competitors and still find it a continual struggle to
provide real value to users? For all our conversations about empathy driven and
user centred design, what's missing in the way we build the web for the very
persons we're meant to be empathising with and why? What can we do about it?

Itâ€™s time to bring a bit of critical theory into our solution architecture and
look at ways our concern for ethics, sustainability, access and social impact
can intersect with our code. Combining insights from design thinking and
intersectional analysis, this talk will look both at how misconstrued design
fails and endangers users at all levels and what it should really mean to
design for the modern web.
