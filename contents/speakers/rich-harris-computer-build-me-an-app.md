Frameworks exist because writing maintainable apps in vanilla JavaScript is
hard. But frameworks aren't free: downloading and parsing those extra bytes
slows things up, just when your users are deciding whether to stick around.

Instead of choosing between bulky frameworks and maintainability nightmares,
what if we could tell the computer 'here are the blueprints, now *you* write
the code'? In this talk we'll discover a new breed of tools, such as Svelte,
that let you do exactly that.
