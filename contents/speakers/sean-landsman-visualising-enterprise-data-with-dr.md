They say that Data is King, and this is true, but when faced with increasingly
large amounts of data, it’s difficult if not impossible to make sense of what
you’re looking at. This beginner to intermediate talk will discuss the benefits
of adding visualations to your application and provide a thorough introduction
to getting started with D3, easing the way to adding your powerful
visualisations to your own applications.
