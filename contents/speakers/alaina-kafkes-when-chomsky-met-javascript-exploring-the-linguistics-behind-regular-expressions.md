Regular expressions are one of the most mind-boggling programming techniques,
but much of their mystery can be elucidated by tracking down how they made it
into JavaScript in the first place. In this talk, I’ll tell the story of the
regular expression, from its humble linguistic origins to its awe-inspiring
power in modern programming languages like JavaScript. Once I reveal to the
audience the linguistic theory behind regular expressions, they’ll feel
empowered to start writing some of their own.
