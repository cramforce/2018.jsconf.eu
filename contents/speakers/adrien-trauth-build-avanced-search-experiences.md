How many checkboxes can you add before your customer just gives up?  When
working with large, flexible data structures, click-based interfaces quickly
become cumbersome; worse, text-based search is often too imprecise. In this
talk, I'll explain how to create a custom query language that allows for
complex searches in just a few keystrokes, and how to integrate it seamlessly
into a web interface.
