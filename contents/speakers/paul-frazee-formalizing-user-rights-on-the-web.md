How should we think about harassment, bullying, bots, and misinformation on the
Web? Have we failed as an industry to protect users, and do we need to
aggressively police our spaces? If so, how do we respond to concerns about
censorship by big business?

In this talk, I'll propose a formal framework for user rights on the Web. I'll
explore the idea that the rights of users on the Web are not all legal, instead
most are founded in the architecture of the Web itself, and by modifying the
Webâ€™s architecture, we can build the political foundation for democratic
representation, community moderation, and social responsibility in an online
society.
