The Web was envisioned as an open platform for publishing and sharing
information, but that vision has been lost: most people will never publish
independently on the Web. What went wrong?

We’ll see how a core facet of the Web platform—setting up and running a
server—locks the vast majority of users out of participating in the Web.
Finally, we'll take a look at the peer-to-peer Web, an experiment to re-imagine
Web publishing, this time without servers.

Feeling skeptical? I'll build and deploy a website on-stage using only my
browser and text editor.
