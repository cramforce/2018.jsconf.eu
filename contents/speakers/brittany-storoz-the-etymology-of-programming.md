Developers are constantly throwing around jargon and buzz words when describing
applications and talking through code. To a new engineer, it can seem like
we're speaking an entirely different language. One might assume we've tried
come up with semantic metaphors for what we're doing, but how often do we
actually stop to think about where these terms came from? This talk will dig
deep into the origins of our lingo and how we've built a vocabulary full of
quirky terms and mysterious phrases.
