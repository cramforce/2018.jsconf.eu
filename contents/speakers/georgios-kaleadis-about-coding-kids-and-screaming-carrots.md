Kids will rule the world with coding as their superpower.
My talk will show how you can playfully teach coding to kids with robots, games
and colorful programming tools. I will talk about the hot debate that every kid
should learn programming and why it matters for their future. By the end of the
day, you will have seen human robots, happy kids and screaming carrots.
