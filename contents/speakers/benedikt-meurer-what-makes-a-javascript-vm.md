JavaScript has definitely been among the most influential technologies for
almost a decade now. A lot of this is due to the sophisticated JavaScript VMs
in modern browsers, Node.js and Electron. In this talk we’re going to explore
important ingredients of these modern JavaScript VMs, specifically how
ChakraCore, the engine that powers Microsoft Edge, and V8, the engine that
powers Google Chrome, compare to each other for certain key features.

Joint talk with [Mathias
Bynens](./mathias-bynens-what-makes-a-javascript-vm.html).
