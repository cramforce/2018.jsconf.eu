For the **5th time** we will have a final (well, actually, the final is the [Relax.js Monday morning brunch](/news/relax-js-monday-brunch/)) get-together with drinks, chill music, and, if the stars align, improvised karaoke on the [Hoppetosse](https://hoppetosse.berlin/). We'll also serve some light food on the way out to help you make it through the night.

The Hoppetosse is docked (and won't move!!) right by our conference venue. No need to go home after the event, and really just follow the stream of people to find it, right after we took the family photo! Make sure to bring your conferencew badge to get access.

Just in case you get lost, the address is: [Eichenstra√üe 4, 12435 Berlin, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/FJdQXm86ecu).
